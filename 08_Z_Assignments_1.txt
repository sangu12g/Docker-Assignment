Your company is ready to start using Docker on some of their servers. In order to get started, they want you to set up and configure Docker CE on a server that has already been set up. You will need to make sure that the server meets the following specifications:

Docker CE is installed and running on the server.
Use Docker CE version 5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic.
Any non-root user has permission to run docker commands.
The default logging driver is set to syslog.


[NOTE: Write the series of commands to achieve above in this file below the question scenario with documentation]


Good luck!


Docker CE is installed and running on the server.
Use Docker CE version 5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic.

step1:sudo apt-get update
 
step2:Download Dependencies
	You’ll need to run these commands to allow your operating system to access the Docker repositories over HTTPS.
	
	sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

step3: Add Docker’s GPG Key
	The GPG key is a security feature.
	To ensure that the software you’re installing is authentic enter
	curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add –

step4:Install the Docker Repository
	sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu  $(lsb_release -cs)  stable" 

step5:for the version you want to instal
	sudo apt-get install docker-ce=<VERSION>
	Example:
	sudo apt-get install docker-ce=5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic



Any non-root user has permission to run docker commands.

step6:Add the ec2-user to the docker group so you can execute Docker commands without using sudo. 
	sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user

step7: Change the permissions of /var/run/docker.sock for the current user.
	sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock

step8:Verify that the ec2-user can run Docker commands without sudo.
	docker info

The default logging driver is set to syslog.

step17:Configure the default logging driver
	To configure the Docker daemon to default to a specific logging driver,
	set the value of log-driver to the name of the logging driver in the daemon.json file, 
	which is located in /etc/docker/ on Linux hosts
	
	note : if file daemon.json is already exist no need to cteate 

	{
  	"log-driver": "syslog"
	}	

step18: Restart the docker
	 systemctl restart docker
	 systemctl status docker 

step19:docker info --format '{{.LoggingDriver}}'
