Your supermarket company is working on expanding their Docker infrastructure. They have an existing service that provides a list of fruit sold in their stores. After measuring the amount of load on this service, they have asked you to scale this service up to a higher number of replicas.

In addition, there is a new service that provides a list of vegetables. This new service needs to be created in the cluster. Set up the swarm cluster to complete the lab, ensure that the swarm meets the following specifications:

1. Scale the service called products-fruit to 5 replicas.

	#first we need to pull the image and create the service as a products-fruit
		Step1: docker pull linuxacademycontent/fruit-service:1.0.0
		Step2: docker service create -p 8080:80 --replicas 5 --name products-fruit linuxacademycontent/fruit-service:1.0.0
		
2. Create a new service called products-vegetables running the linuxacademycontent/vegetable-service:1.0.0 image.
3. Publish products-vegetables on port 8081. The application listens on port 80.
		
		Step1: docker pull linuxacademycontent/vegetable-service:1.0.0
		Step2: docker service create -p 8081:80 --replicas 1 --name products-vegetables2 linuxacademycontent/vegetable-service:1.0.0

4. Run products-vegetables with 3 replicas.
		
		Step1: docker service scale products-vegetables2=3
		
You can test the products-fruit service from any swarm node (including the manager) with curl localhost:8080.
		#we hit the below link it will show you all fruits list 
		curl 52.13.106.36:8080
		
Once products-vegetables is running, you should be able to test it from any swarm node (including the manager) with curl localhost:8081.
		#we hit the below link it will show you all fruits list
		curl 52.13.106.36:8081

Good luck!
