39. type below command:-
	docker images --help
Now, try to run command that proves the concept of following three options:-
1. -a docker images -a (Shows all the images present in local repo)
2. -f docker images --filter "before=nginx" (filter)
3. -q docker images -q (shows all the images id )

write atleast 1 command using each option above and prove their concepts as described in the --help.


40. type below command:-
	docker ps --help
Now, try to run command that proves the concept of following six options:-
1. -a docker ps -a (all)
2. -f docker ps -a --filter "status=running"  (filter)
3. -q docker ps -q ( Only display numeric IDs like container id)
4. -n  
5. -l docker ps -a -l (it shows only latest created container)
6. -s docker ps --size (shows you size of the container )
